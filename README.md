# Automated-Face-Recognition
The Automated Face Recognition Python App is a sophisticated system that utilizes artificial neural network techniques to identify individuals based on their facial features. The system is divided into two stages: the learning stage and the testing stage. During the learning stage, the system acquires images, performs pre-processing, image filtering, feature extraction, and learning. Subsequently, in the testing stage, the system employs the trained model to recognize faces and identify individuals accurately.

# Features
Powerful graphical user interface (GUI) for user-friendly interactions.
Learning stage with image acquisition, pre-processing, filtering, feature extraction, and neural network training.
Testing stage for real-time face recognition using trained models.
